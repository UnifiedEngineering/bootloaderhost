This is a git subtree split from the SCSI2SD project
(http://www.codesrc.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=SCSI2SD)
by Michael McMaster. He integrated the code Cypress provides to talk
to their USB HID bootloaders in the PSoC3/5LP (cybootloaderutils) with the
awesome HIDAPI project (hey Alan!). HIDAPI is included as a submodule that
will have to be initialized as follows:

git submodule init && git submodule update
